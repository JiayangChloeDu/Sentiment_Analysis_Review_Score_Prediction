# Sentiment Analysis & Review Score Prediction
I assisted a home decor company with three brands in boosting their profits through two main approaches. Firstly, as they plan to build a third distribution center to enhance customer experience—specifically shipping speed—I'm tasked with determining the optimal location for this new center in the central region. Secondly, embracing the principle that the customer is the foundation of everything, I analyzed customer preferences based on products, vendors, geography, and timing. The second goal is to guide the company in creating the right products at the right prices, distributed through the most suitable platforms and at the lowest costs, thus maximizing profits and customer satisfaction.

For the first objective, I've conducted an analysis that includes customer demographics, geographical locations, product purchases, and potential correlations among these factors. Additionally, extensive research on labor costs, weather patterns, and manufacturing conditions has been combined for a comprehensive analysis. The second objective addresses the company's data limitations by devising innovative methods for data collection and then employ some techniques to help better understand customer preferences and behaviors.

The culmination of this project is to craft a compelling narrative that presents the findings and strategies to the company's CEO. The key is to translate the complex data and analysis into a clear and impactful story that outlines how the proposed distribution center location and customer preference insights will drive profit and operational efficiency. This storytelling not only detailed the rigorous research and data collection undertaken but will also highlight the projected benefits in a way that aligns with the CEO's vision and the company's broader strategic goals.
